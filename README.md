# Java-Squad

## Introduction


Welcome to Java Squad course about learning Java programming language!  

Before we get started with this course, there are couple of things you need to have in place.

  - You need to `clone` this repository first.
    - <details>
      <summary>How?</summary>  

      - Install `git`. [Link](https://git-scm.com/downloads). 
      - Restart your terminal.
      - Navigate to the directory that this repository should live.
      - Run this command in your terminal:  

      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/Java-Learning-Squad/Java-Squad.git
      ```

      - You should have `Java-Squad` folder now.
    </details>
  - Make sure **JDK** is installed in your environment.
    - In your terminal, type `javac -version`.
    - <span style="color: green">If you get a version number, you are all set.</span>
    - If you get `command not found`, google how to install JDK.
  - We will use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as our text editor, as it provides syntax highlighting and some cool extensions to use in the future.

## How to execute a file?

Once you install the JDK, you will have access to two commands `javac` and `java`.

I have a Hello World file in `/Hello_World` directory for you to try out. 

```bash
cd Hello_World
javac Hello.java
java Hello
```

You should see
